# Alarms & Alerts

We are periodically running a number of different checks. When these checks fail we generate an __Alarm__. When a person gets an e-mail concerning an alarm, we call that an __Alert__. 
At the moment tests are running as cron jobs on our main analytics node (uct3-lx2.uchicago.edu).
