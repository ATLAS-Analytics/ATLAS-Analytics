# Alarms & Alerts

We are periodically running a number of different checks. When these checks fail we generate an __Alarm__. When a person gets an e-mail concerning an alarm, we call that an __Alert__. 
Cron jobs run on the MWT2 kubernetes cluster. All the code and k8s deployments are in this [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/ATLAS-Analytics/AlarmAndAlertService) 
System is described [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1siyfbPei5qhyZLfHGrZCHJkcVQsXYaYHODqXHdemkjI/edit?usp=sharing).
To subscribe to alerts use this [link](https://goo.gl/forms/RfiUN8xlBBRdjNJ33). Each mail you recieve will contain a link that one can use to change mailing preferences.
