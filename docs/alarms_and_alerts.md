# Alarms & Alerts

We are periodically running a number of different checks. When these checks fail we generate an __Alarm__. When a person gets an e-mail concerning an alarm, we call that an __Alert__. 
At the moment tests are running as cron jobs on our main analytics node (uct3-lx2.uchicago.edu). 
System is described [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1siyfbPei5qhyZLfHGrZCHJkcVQsXYaYHODqXHdemkjI/edit?usp=sharing).
To subscribe to alerts use this [link](https://goo.gl/forms/RfiUN8xlBBRdjNJ33). Each mail you recieve will contain a link that one can use to change mailing preferences.
